## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore and preprocess a sales dataset to prepare it for machine learning modeling. The dataset contains information such as the date of sales, country, store, product type, and the number of units sold. Key tasks include handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizing data distributions.

## Dataset Description

### Train Dataset:
- **Rows:** 230,130
- **Columns:** 6
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `date`: Date of the record
  - `country`: Country where the sales occurred
  - `store`: Store type
  - `product`: Product type
  - `num_sold`: Number of units sold (target variable)

### Test Dataset:
- **Rows:** 98,550
- **Columns:** 5
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `date`: Date of the record
  - `country`: Country where the sales occurred
  - `store`: Store type
  - `product`: Product type

---

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Datetime Conversion:**
   - Converted the `date` column to `datetime` format.
   - Extracted `year`, `quarter`, and `month` as new features.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified 8,871 missing values in the `num_sold` column.
   - Planned strategies for imputation (e.g., KNN Imputer or statistical methods).

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Removed the `date` column after extracting time-based features.
   - Dropped the `id` column to avoid data leakage.

4. **Data Types Optimization:**
   - Optimized data types to reduce memory usage.

## Data Visualization

- **Categorical Variables:**
  - Visualized the distribution of categorical variables like `country`, `store`, and `product` using bar plots.
  - Annotated bar plots with count values for better interpretability.

- **Numerical Variables:**
  - Analyzed distributions of numerical variables such as `num_sold` using summary statistics and histograms.
